# Portfolio
A good way to make yourself known in the world of programming is to create a portfolio. It is really good when all of your impressive achievements, skills, and samples are collected in one place. If you know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can even publish your portfolio on the website you created yourself! This project is a great way to present yourself as a specialist.
